##Portfolio plugin for OctoberCMS

This plugin allow to create a portfolio into octobercms.

There is a component called worklist with two layouts. The datail portfolio page is loaded using ajax.

I use a compressed version of CSS but I have included and uncompressed version of the CSS and the **SASS files coded with compass** for modifying anything you want.

In the backend you can choose an image for each work and order them by drag & drop.

Clone git repository into a folder called individuart inside folder plugins of OctoberCMS:

`git clone https://github.com/individuart/work` 

The final route may be something like:

**[octobercms-folder]/plugins/individuart/work**
